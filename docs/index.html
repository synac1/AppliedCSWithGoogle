			/google/engedu/anagrams">Anagrams</a>
			<p>
				Game Logic, This game consists of player getting
				all anagrams words as possible for a given word,
				but this is not just like any anagram game, 
				but the purpose of this game is also, getting 
				all anagrams plus one letter and this word has
				to be a valid word in the English dictionary and 
				it's not only a substring of the given word.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this implementation, we are giving  starter 
				code. We mostly work on
				Anagram Dictionary class, do a small 
				modification to the Main Activity Class, after 
				optimizing the AnagramDictionarhy at the end.
				the activity layout is created for us.

			/tree/master/WordStack_starter">WordStack</a>
			<p>
				Game Logic, This game consists of player 
				guessing two words out of one word 
				compound of two words where the letters of the 
				words are in order of each word. For example:
				"cdatog" is a word compound of "cat" and "dog" 
				player will have to drag and drop the letters
				on their corresponding box, and the tricky thing 
				is that the player will see one letter at the 
				time.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this implementation, we are giving  starter 
				code. We modify the Main Activity class, Stacked
				Layout class and the Letter Tile class, we 
				don't touch the Layout activity. See more of 
				the Description here: <a href="https://applied
				csskills.withgoogle.com/unit?unit=10">

			/tree/master/ScarnesDice" alt="Scarnes Dice Source Code"
			>ScarnesDice</a>
			<p>	
				Game logic  consist of two players rolling dice,
				if the player rolls 1  players loses all the
				turn points, and let the other player rolls, 
				if the player gets more than one, the player
				has the option of continue rolling the dice for
				that turn or skip next rolling and give the
				chance to the other player. The winner is the
				first to reach to 100 points or more.
			</p>
			<p>	
				In this implementation
				it is the player against the 
				computer.
				For this game we are not given a started code.
				So we start from scratch, the aim of this 
				project I understand is to better understand
				android concepts.
			</p>
			<p>
				Components: Activity Layout  and an Acitivity 
				Class. Activity Layout must have an imageView, 
				Two TextViews, and three Butons.
